This was my first taste of presenting at a big name developer conference, and what a great event it turned out to be. If you attended my talk on Yammer API Development I hope you found it worthwhile. Please @mention me on the [Yammer Developer Network](http://yammer.com/yammerdevelopersnetwork) with any follow-up questions.

There were some awesome from [Elijah Manor](http://www.elijahmanor.com/), [Bill Wagner](http://billwagner.azurewebsites.net/blog/demos-from-devintersection), and many others. Co-locating the conference alongside [Angle Brackets](http://anglebrackets.org/) and the other Intersection conferences allowed me to dip into relevant talks from a range of speakers I normally wouldn't be able to see.

If you are interested in more of this, the [next one](http://www.devintersection.com/sharepoint.aspx) will be held in Orlando in April.
