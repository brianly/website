I've uploaded the presentation to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/brianly/google-app-engine-programming">Speaker Deck</a> and you can <a href="/downloads/GoogleAppEngineIntroPythonCodeCamp2011.pdf">download a PDF</a> from my site too. The <a href="http://hg.killaloo.org/bookmarkz/src">code sample</a> I used during the presentation is available on BitBucket, and I'm going to be making various improvements to it over the coming weeks.
