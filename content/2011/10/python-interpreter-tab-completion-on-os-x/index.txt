This is mainly for me own reference, but it is probably something that other people will find useful. If you attempt to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/rlcompleter.html">rlcompleter</a> module on the Mac you'll find that tab completion does not work correctly. Apparently this is because Apple ship a neutered version of readline.

To get completion working you have to use a different argument to readline.parse_and_bind(). The base example uses:
<pre>readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")</pre>

Change that line to: 

<pre>readline.parse_and_bind ("bind ^I rl_complete")</pre>
