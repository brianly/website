Johansson, Steve Riley" src="/images/book-protect-your-network.jpg" alt="Protect Your Windows Network : From Perimeter to Data, by Jesper M. Johansson, Steve Riley" /></a>When I attended <a href="http://www.mseventseurope.com/TechEd/06/pre/default.aspx">TechEd Europe</a> in July 2002 one of the most interesting sessions was presented by <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/steriley/">Steve Riley</a>. This was an overflow session presented during lunch, and I thought it would be interesting to check out something I hadn't planned to look at. The session covered use of <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/IPsec.html">IPSec</a>, and the presentation style was very engaging. Rather than discuss technology in search of a solution, Steve solicited a number of scenarios from the audience and presented the hidden power of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/secmgmt/sm121504.mspx">IPSec</a>.

Many years pass, and I spot a blog entry from <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/jesper_johansson">Jesper Johansson</a>, where he book that is co-authored with Steve. I ordered it almost immediately from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=brianlyttleco-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0321336437%3Fv%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Amazon.com</a> and I wasn't let down. This book is a gem for any developer who is trying to understand infrastructure security and the capabilities of the Windows platform. It's a fairly easy read and only delves into the necessary detail, avoiding coverage of mundane technical details that are presented on <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">TechNet</a>. To get the most out of this book you'll want your own test rig set up on virtualised hardware (think VMWare or Virtual Server) with a domain controller, certificate services, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/default.mspx">ISA Server</a> and the like.

It's really hard to fault this book, maybe it should be available in hardback?
