Maybe this year will be the one where I get back on the path to regular blogging. Between 2002 and 2004 I was a fairly frequent blogger and then things got substantially busier when I moved to the US. The obligatory first post these days seems to be some background information on the blogger, but I'm leaving that for my <a href="/about/">about</a> page.

Instead I'll just talk a little about some highlights of 2008. By far the biggest highlight of the year was my wedding in October - Sarah really is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. I find it hard to believe that in a couple of weeks we will be celebrating our fourth year together, as they say 'time flies when you are having fun!'.

The other main highlight of 2008 was my cycling progress and I completed 3 big rides: the 5 Boro Bike Tour, a metric centrury in Lancaster, and the Lance Armstrong ride in Philadelphia. Cycling was something that Sarah got me interested in, and I am looking forward to lots more in 2009!
