I was asked to take <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianly/sets/72157629426130039/">a few photos</a> for this <a href="http://redsnakephilly.org/about/">event</a> by fellow pythonista <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tpanzarella">Tom Panzarella</a>.

I think they turned out OK for the most part - although the EF 70-200 L saved my arse in the end. It was difficult shooting with the lighting setup at the venue, but I'll be back there to get some more practice.

All of the photos are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianly/sets/72157629426130039/">over on Flickr</a> and they were even <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/02/24/10-presenters-bring-ruby-and-python-knowledge-to-second-annual-redsnake-philly-meetup-video">linked to</a> by Technically Philly!
