Thanks for attending my talk if you were able to make it over to Abington. I had to leave after my presentation so I didn't get a chance to see any of the other presentations, but the consensus appears to be that it was another great event. The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/blytt/building-mobile-web-apps-with-jqm-and-cordova-on-azure">slides</a> are posted below for anyone that wants to reference them.
