<p><img class="img-right" src="/images/bl2011_bw_225x150.jpg" alt="Brian Lyttle - portrait photo by Sarah Gray ;)" width="225px" height="150px" />I&#8217;m a Northern Irish expatriate living in the western suburbs of Philadelphia, PA. I was born in Londonderry and moved to England for university. I&#8217;ve been running this site on and off since October 1999. Someday I might get time to write a script to import a lot of the old content.</p>
<p>Shortly after moving to the US in November 2004 I met the love of my life. Sarah is absolutely wonderful. So wonderful in fact, that we got married in October 2008!</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve got an awesome job at <a href="http://www.yammer.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.yammer.com']);">Yammer</a> in the nexus between engineering, infrastructure, and our customer success managers. As an Implementation Engineer I get to do all the fun stuff I enjoy. Our solution engineering team rocks, and we&#8217;re always on the lookout for great people.</p>
<p>Previously I was at <a href="http://www.liquidhub.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.liquidhub.com']);">LiquidHub</a>, where I moved up through the ranks to Solution Architect. I spent a lot of time writing software for Microsoft platforms like ASP.NET MVC and SharePoint; but I was also working with cloud platforms like Amazon EC2, and building interesting things with the latest GUI toolkits. For the past couple of years my personal projects have been hacked out in Python. New languages and technologies are emerging every day, why not explore a little?</p>
<p>Before joining LiquidHub, I founded a boutique consulting company called <a href="http://www.sourcefoundry.co.uk" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.sourcefoundry.co.uk']);">Source Foundry</a>. It was a fun affair, just me and a few contractors when there was a need for heavy lifting. Running my own company was a great, but exhausting experience. I&#8217;ll do it again someday, but I&#8217;ll build a product instead.</p>
<h2>Not Work</h2>
<p>When I&#8217;m not working I enjoy <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brianly" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','flickr.com']);">photography</a>, helping out at a local <a href="http://www.savoy.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.savoy.org']);">theatre company</a>, and cycling with the <a href="http://www.kindlehill.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.kindlehill.com']);">Kindle Hill</a> crew. Since the introduction of the 5K race at PyCon I've also been trying to get in a little running too.</p>
<h2>Places I&#8217;ve lived</h2>
<p>I should really write about my experiences in some of these places, but here is the list for now.</p>
